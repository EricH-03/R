# R
A repository for my R projects and learning

This includes assignments from the Data Science (STAT 123) and the Introduction to Probability and Statistics I (STAT 260) courses I took in the second semester of my first year at UVic.

STAT 123 focused on the combination of computational and inferential thought required in order to effectively analyze data. Main topics included: R programming, data visualization in R, data wrangling, statistical foundations and introductory regression modelling

STAT 260 was more concerned with the mathematical foundations of statistical inference but had some assignments using R. Topics inculded : Descriptive statistics; elementary probability theory; random variables, discrete and continuous probability distributions, expectation, joint, marginal and conditional distributions; linear functions of random variables; random sampling and sampling distributions; point and interval estimation; classical hypothesis testing and significance testing.

Unfortunately, the majority of the assignments, particularly the later more complex assignments were done in the Computer lab and were wiped and I no longer have access.
